After 4 years in the sun, I moved back to the UK to start a career in management consulting, working with some amazing clients to deliver a multitude of eCommerce, CRM and ERP programmes. After this, I held senior IT and eCommerce Director positions for large brands and, until starting at ANDigital, was running my own eCommerce strategy business.",
