  "careerBackground":"I started out with an electronic engineering degree at York University, supported by a Ministry of Defence sponsorship. However always being more interested in the digital and computing side of things I moved into web design with a number of freelance projects. Since then I’ve worked for distribution and media businesses developing global B2B and B2C end to end commerce systems, and working more recently on community and enterprise collaboration projects. Initially a developer, I’ve spent the last few years in Business Analyst roles.",
