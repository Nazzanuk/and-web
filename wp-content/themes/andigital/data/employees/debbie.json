  "careerBackground":"In my former life I was a Management Consultant for about 10 years specialising in Organisational Change & Transformation.  This was when my passion for organisational culture really began.  I then moved in-house to deliver strategic people projects and got a taste for employee engagement as well as diversity and internal crowd-sourcing.",
  "role":"My role at ANDigital is Chief Happiness Officer which means I am responsible for the Culture, Values and Employee Engagement for all of our Squads and Ground Ops – three things that I believe have a fundamental impact on how much people want to come and work with us, and clients want us to work with them.  Getting these things right is the key to being a remarkable organisation.",
  "superHeroPower":"My Superhero power would be the ability to duplicate myself – being in two places at once would make life a whole lot more relaxing!"
