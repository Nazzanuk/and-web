  "careerBackground":"I have recently graduated from Manchester University where I studied Computer Science. I particularly enjoy user interface design and development and, since starting at ANDigital, I have loved working in a truly Agile team. In a ‘past life' I worked as a scuba diving instructor, which was great fun and gave me a brilliant experience in a VERY different environment.",
  "role":"As an Associate Product Developer, I work on all aspects of the projects. I also get the chance to do some analysis so I can decide where my skills and interests lie and which way to take my career. I don’t think I have an area of expertise yet but I come into work everyday ready to learn something new!",
  "superHeroPower":"I would be able to breath underwater so I don’t have to take all my scuba gear with me!"
